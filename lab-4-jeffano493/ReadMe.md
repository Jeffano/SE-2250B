# Lab 4: PyGame Basics - Collect the Coins game

Create a pygame in which the user tries to collect the coins into the bank.
Here are the game rules:
- The bank can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen using the arrow keys with speed of 100 pixels 
- The coin starts at a random location at the top of the screen and moves down with initial speeds of 20 pixels.
- The speed of the coin doubles every time the user collects additional 10 coins

**Remember the divide-and-conqure stragy**
- If you break down the game into smaller parts/steps you'll realize it's much easier than it may initially looks
- I left some comments in the py file to guide you through the creation of the game, it's up to you if you would like to follow them.
- Feel free to use the image provided with this repository or change them if you like.
